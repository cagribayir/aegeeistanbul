			<h3>
				Thanks for the response CD,
			</h3>
			<p>
				I appreciate you have taken the time to address all points in your lengthy response.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m particularly interested in the topics regarding communications with internal and external audiences and how information is handled within AEGEE. By what I can read in your response I see that the current AEGEE approach that justifies information restrictions in the DPPS is a bit outdated and pre-democratic for 2020’s standards in Europe.
			</p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 30px">
				Let me please show the below extract from the upcoming Transparency Proposal where I explain with a bit more detail the issue we have:
			</p>
			<h3>
				--------------------
			</h3>
			<p>
				<b>Setting these amounts of AEGEE content as internal goes against principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open data</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open government</a>.</b> Only if you are a member, and want to accept Google Workplace terms and conditions (GW for brevity) you are allowed to gain access to Agora booklets, candidate lists and election results. Note that being an AEGEE member is a thing, and having to necessarily accept a GW account to access this information is another.
			</p>
			<p>
				This would be equivalent as if during a France general election only French citizens that held a GW account provided by the government could access elections’ procedures, candidates and results. Government announcements and access to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_gazette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official journal</a> would be restricted to only French GW account holders to protect the freedom of speech of the country. Then the French government would restrict information about the national budget with the premise that such information being available publicly could hamper foreign investment in the country. This sounds more like North Korea. But remember, even when this parallelism looks too similar to what happens in AEGEE, we are still democratic and transparent, right?
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s ponder for a second about the full extent of the unjustified restrictions that AEGEE applies to its content and how this compares to similar organisations. In contrast to what AEGEE does, any company that trades in most stock exchanges around the world has to publish publicly a lengthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual report</a> with its finances (<a href="https://abc.xyz/investor">Google</a>, <a href="https://investors.vodafone.com/reports-information/results-reports-presentations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vodafone</a>, <a href="https://www.ing.com/Investor-relations/Financial-performance/Annual-reports.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ING</a>). Not only that, this also applies to companies not publicly listed. The annual reports of <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any British limited company</a> are public. <i>But AEGEE is not a company</i> you may say. You are right, it is a NGO, which I assume to be even more transparent than a company. Let’s look at how other NGOs deal with transparency: <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/about/our-finances-and-accountability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxfam</a>, <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/who-we-are/finances">Red Cross</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/our-finances" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amnesty International</a>. Financial information open and voluntarily available on their own websites, in addition to the public and compulsory UK <a href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register of charities</a> (check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/202918">Oxfam</a> on this registry). <i>But those are not the kind of NGO that AEGEE is</i>. Umm, let’s get more granular: is AIESEC something more similar to AEGEE? Find publicly its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://issuu.com/aiesecuk/docs/18.19_aiesec_uk_annual_report__spread_">financial information</a> (and in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/274779">UK Register of charities</a>). What about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org">ESN</a>? Even they are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://esn.org/annual-report">more transparent</a> than AEGEE! All of them publish reports and nice charts about the organisation's finances and other matters. And do not forget that most developed countries <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl">openly report finances, budgets and transparency reports</a>. <b>All this information being available on the Internet with a simple search and no registration whatsoever.</b> It is not an exaggeration to say that the majority of organisations of any kind in the world are more transparent than AEGEE.
			</p>
			<p>
				The fallacy to restrict these big amounts of information is always the same: it is necessary because otherwise we overshare too much, at the same time that there is some legal impediment forcing us to do so (but those laws are never specified). AEGEE is obsessed with external risks jeopardizing our integrity and freedom of speech (freedom of speech which is crushed by the same DPPS). But it has totally forgotten that <b>the biggest threats are internal</b>. Internal threads that from time to time make some rogue antenna treasurer or board to practice <i>creative accounting</i>. And same internal threads that cause an extraordinary Agora to happen in December. This is what actually poses a real legal risk for AEGEE and not <i>oversharing</i> (whatever that vague term means).

				It would be good to start acknowledging the issue:
			</p>
			<h3>
				AEGEE has a lack of transparency.
			</h2>
			<p>
				The earlier we set this clear the sooner we can start working on it all together.

				In the next days the proposal will be published containing an explanation in deep of the issue, and two specific solutions to address these concerns.
